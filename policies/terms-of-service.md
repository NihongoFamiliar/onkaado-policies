## The Onkaado Terms of Service

Effective date: **June 1, 2023**

### A. Definitions

**Simple version:** *These terms are used throughout the Agreement, and have specific meanings. It will help to know what is meant when each of these terms are used.*

1. _“Agreement”_ refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, and notices containted or referenced in this document (the _“Terms of Service”_ or _“Terms”_) and all other operating rules, policies (including the Onkaado Privacy Policy, available at [onkaado.com/privacy](https://www.onkaado.com/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website.
2. _“Content”_ refers to content featured or displayed throughout the Website, including without limitation: text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, audio, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. _“Content”_ also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. “Your Content” is Content that you create or own.
3. _“Service”_ refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by Nihongo Familiar.
4. _“Nihongo Familiar”_, _“We”_, and _“Us”_ refer to Nihongo Familiar LLC, as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
5. _“User”_, _“You”_, and _“Your”_ refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the account; or that directs the use of the account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government accounts (See [Section B.4): Additional Terms](#b-account-terms)).
6. _“Website”_ or _“Onkaado”_ refers to Nihongo Familiar's website located at [onkaado.com](https://www.onkaado.com/),  all content, Services, and products provided by Nihongo Familiar at or through the Website. It also refers to Nihongo Familiar-owned subdomains of onkaado.com. Occasionally, Websites owned by Nihongo Familiar may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or Service.

### B. Account Terms

**Simple version:** *A human must create your account; you must be 13 years of age or older; and you must provide a valid email address. You alone are responsible for your account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your account. You are responsible for keeping your account secure.*

#### 1. Required Information

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other personally identifiable information requested, such as your real name, is optional unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case, we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid account](#h-payment) (in which case, we need additional information for billing purposes).

#### 2. Account Requirements

We have a few simple rules for accounts on Onkaado’s Service.

- You must be a human to create an account. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted.
- To comply with United States law, You must be 13 years of age or older to have an account on Onkaado. Our Service is not targetted to children under 13 years of age, and we do not permit any Users under 13 years of age on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s account immediately](#i-cancellation-and-termination). If You are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
- You may not use as a username that is a name or trademark subject to any rights of another person or entity without appropriate authorization. You may not use a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar, or obscene.
- Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people.

#### 3. User Account Security

- You are responsible for keeping your account secure while you use our Service.
- You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. Onkaado can not and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
- You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account.
- You will promptly [notify Onkaado](mailto:hello@onkaado.com) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your account, including any unauthorized use of your password or account.

#### 4. Additional Terms

In some situations, third parties’ terms may apply to your use of Onkaado. For example, you may download an application that integrates with Onkaado. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties’ terms govern their relationships with you.

### C. Acceptable Use

**Simple version:** *While using the Service, you must follow this Acceptable Use Policy, which includes some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the Service, and other limitations. Ultimately, be kind to eachother and do good. Also, don't break laws.*

- use our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any other form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers, such as get-rich-quick schemes;
- attempt to disrupt or tamper with Nihongo Familiar’s servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place undue burden on Nihongo Familiar’s servers through automated means, or to access Nihongo Familiar’s Service in ways that exceed your authorization;

- violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person’s personal information without consent.

#### 4. Services Usage Limits

You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without Nihongo Familiar’s express written permission.

#### 5. Scraping

Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. You may scrape the Website for the following reasons:

- Researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from Onkaado for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are open access.
- Archivists may scrape Onkaado for public data for archival purposes.

You may not scrape Onkaado for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling Onkaado users’ personal information, such as to advertisers, recruiters, or job boards.

All use of Onkaado data gathered through scraping must comply with the [Onkaado Privacy Policy](https://www.onkaado.com/privacy).

#### 6. Privacy

Misuse of Onkaado Users’ Personal Information is prohibited.

Any person, entity, or service collecting data from Onkaado must comply with the [Onkaado Privacy Policy](https://www.onkaado.com/privacy), particularly in regards to the collection of our Users’ Personal Information (as defined in the [Onkaado Privacy Policy](https://www.onkaado.com/privacy)). If you collect any Onkaado User’s Personal Information from Onkaado, you agree that you will only use the Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from Onkaado, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and “do not contact” requests from Nihongo Familiar or Onkaado Users.

#### 7. Excessive Bandwidth Use

If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to other Onkaado customers, we reserve the right to suspend your account or throttle your access until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.

#### 8. User Protection

You agree not to engage in activity that significantly harms our Users. We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting our Users as a whole.

### D. User-Generated Content

**Simple version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the Service. We have the right to remove content or close accounts if we need to.*

#### 1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

#### 2. Nihongo Familiar May Remove Content

We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any Nihongo Familiar terms or policies.

#### 3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Content you create or own (“Your Content”). If you’re posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other Onkaado Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4–D.5. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting Nihongo Familiar the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4–D.5. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers.

#### 4. License Grant to Us

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant Nihongo Familiar the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.

#### 5. Moral Rights

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this Agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant Nihongo Familiar the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

### E. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy

If you believe that content on our Website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](#e-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on Onkaado violates your rights, please contact us by emailing [copyright@onkaado.com](mailto:copyright@onkaado.com). There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We disable and terminate the accounts of users who may infringe upon the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of Nihongo Familiar or others, in appropriate circumstances and at our sole discretion.

### F. Intellectual Property Notice

**Simple version:** *We own the Service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

#### 1. Nihongo Familiar’s Rights to Content

Nihongo Familiar and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © Nihongo Familiar LLC. All rights reserved.

### G. Advertising on Onkaado

**Simple version:** *We generally prohibit the use of Onkaado for advertising, so it does not become a trough for spam. Nobody needs that noise.*

Advertising Content is limited to the promotion of personal projects or personal professional development. Any advertising for a business entity is prohibited without approval by Nihongo Familiar.

Any Advertising Content, like all Content, must not violate the law or these Terms of Service, such as the restrictions on appropriate use of Onkaado. We reserve the right to remove any advertisements that, in our sole discretion, violate any Nihongo Familiar terms or policies.

### H. Payment

**Simple version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of Onkaado. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

#### 1. Pricing

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [onkaado.com/settings/subscription](https://www.onkaado.com/settings/subscription). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term. Decreases in a subscription price may be applied in the middle of a payment term.

#### 2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes

- We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.

**Simple version:** *You may close your account at any time. If you do, we’ll treat your information responsibly.*

#### 1. Subscription Cancellation

You can cancel your subscription at any time via the [subscription settings](https://www.onkaado.com/settings/subscription). Your access to paid content and features will remain in effect until the end of your current billing period. At the end of the billing period, access to paid content and features will be revoked, though your account will still be accessible and you can re-subscribe at any time. As part of keeping your account accessible, we will retain your data indefinitely, or until such time that you request an account deletion.

You can delete your account at any time by [going into your settings](https://www.onkaado.com/settings/) in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen and then navigating to the “Advanced Settings” section. As a precaution, you must deactivate your account subscription before being able to delete your account.

#### 3. Upon Deletion

Your account will remain accessible for a probationary period of 30 days after the date you have started the deletion process on our Service. This allows you to cancel your account's deletion if you decide to continue maintaining your account instead.

If you decide to continue maintaining your account during this probationary period, you can cancel the deletion of your account by [going into your settings](https://www.onkaado.com/settings) in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen and then navigating to the “Advanced Settings” section.

After those 30 days, if you decide not to cancel your account's deletion, your account's information will be removed from Onkaado's system beyond what records we need to to comply with legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our Agreements. This information can not be recovered once your account is deleted.

#### 4. Nihongo Familiar May Terminate

Nihongo Familiar has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. Nihongo Familiar reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.
